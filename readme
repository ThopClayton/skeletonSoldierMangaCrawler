The manga is downloaded from the following link:
https://skeleton-soldier.online/

The source code is in web2pdf.py
The processing folder will contain the individual images of each chapter as they are being downloaded.
The chapters folder will contain the chapters of the manga.
_internal is the data required for the .exe file to work on most operating systems.
You could also run the program via executing web2pdf.py if you have all the required python packages installed on your system.


for me, the dev:
to create the exe, go to the root of the mod and execute the following line in the window's command prompt:
python -m PyInstaller [FILENAME].py
two folders will be generated. You can delete "build", and in the other folder place "_internal" and the executable in the root folder, then you
delete the second generated folder. The .spec file should also be removed.
